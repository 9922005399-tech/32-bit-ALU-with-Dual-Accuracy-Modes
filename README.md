# 32-bit-ALU-with-Dual-Accuracy-Modes
This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of switching between accurate and approximate computation modes at runtime. The architecture focuses on improving energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable computational accuracy for error-tolerant applications.

# Tools Used
Software: Xilinx Vivado

Hardware Platform: Xilinx Virtex-5 (XC5VLX50T) FPGA

Language: Verilog HDL


# Key Features

Dual accuracy modes (accurate and approximate)

Runtime reconfigurability

Optimized for low power and reduced area utilization

Single unified Verilog implementation

# How to Use

Open the project in Vivado.

Add the Verilog file Approx_ALU.v.

Synthesize and implement the design.

Simulate to verify both accuracy modes.
