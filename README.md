# 32-bit-ALU-with-Dual-Accuracy-Modes
This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of switching between accurate and approximate computation modes at runtime. The architecture focuses on improving energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable computational accuracy for error-tolerant applications.
